StartrCSS is a simple, lightweight, and flexible CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first projects on the web.
Powered by Flexbox and CSS variables and templated in Pug and LESS.

Our demo comes with a few examples of how you can use Startr to create your own website or web app. More examples are coming soon.

We include Pocketbase as a starting point for your project. It's a simple alternative to Firebase that uses a SQLite file as a database and is powered by Go. It's perfect for small projects and prototypes.

Pocketbase even comes with a simple admin panel to manage your data and users.
